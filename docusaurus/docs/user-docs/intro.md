# Welcome to the Strapi User Guide!


<SubtleCallout title="Developer Docs, User Guide, and Strapi Cloud documentation" emoji="📍">


The documentation for Strapi contains 3 main sections, accessible from the top navigation bar:


- 🧑‍💻 The **[Developer Docs](/dev-docs/intro)** contain all the technical information related to the setup, advanced usage, customization, and update of your Strapi v5 application.
- 🧑‍🏫 The **User Guide** that you're currently reading is all about using Strapi's admin panel.
- ☁️ The **[Strapi Cloud](/cloud/intro)** documentation is about deploying your Strapi application to Strapi Cloud and managing your Strapi Cloud projects and settings.


</SubtleCallout>


This user guide contains the functional documentation related to all features available in the admin panel of your Strapi application.


Once you have logged in you can acess your Strapi dashboard as shown in the image below:
